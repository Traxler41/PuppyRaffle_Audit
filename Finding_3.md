**[I-1] The function `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner()` is a weak pseudo-random generator function.**

**Description:**
It is tough to create actual randomness in a blockchain envioronment due to the deterministic nature of the blockchain. However, in `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner()` function, pseudo-randomness is generated using the timestamp of the transaction to enter the raffle to select winner randomly. However this can be manipulated and can be compromised.

**Impact:**
This method of creating randomness might not due to Time Stamp Manipulation Attack. An attacker can enter the raffle at a specific instance so that he is selected as the winner, denying other participants a fair chance. 

**Recommended Mitigation:**
1. It is highly recommended to use a strong source of randomness, for example, ChainLink's Verifiable Randomness Function using the following code:
```javascript
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/VRFConsumerBase.sol";

contract RandomnessExample is VRFConsumerBase {
    bytes32 internal keyHash;
    uint256 internal fee;
    uint256 public randomResult;

    constructor(address _vrfCoordinator, address _link, bytes32 _keyHash, uint256 _fee)
        VRFConsumerBase(_vrfCoordinator, _link)
    {
        keyHash = _keyHash;
        fee = _fee;
    }

    function getRandomNumber() external returns (bytes32 requestId) {
        require(LINK.balanceOf(address(this)) >= fee, "Not enough LINK");
        return requestRandomness(keyHash, fee);
    }

    function fulfillRandomness(bytes32 requestId, uint256 randomness) internal override {
        randomResult = randomness;
    }
}
```

2. To make this randomness more strong and secure, it is recommended that combination of two or more random number generators are used. Suppose, ChainLink's VRF with some other source.
